# Covid-Lockdown-Project
This is the repository that houses our covid lockdown project. We tried to check if lockdown really helps in a pandemic like covid19. Also we tried to study what kind of lockdown would be the best for the population and the economy of the population. 

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

As this code is in the form of Google Colaboratory Notebook, you can start running the code straight from the browser. But if you're willing to run the code locally, you'd be needing the following packages
```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Probability of 0.1
Nearest neighbors vary from 10 to 50

Nearest Neighbor 10
Probability vary from 0.1 to 1.0


### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
